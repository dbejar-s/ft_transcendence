    "aboutDescription": "The main purpose of this website is to play Pong versus other players. Users can participate in a live match directly on the website, with two players using the same keyboard. A tournament system allows multiple players to take turns competing. Each participant must register with an alias at the beginning of a tournament, and a matchmaking system organizes the matches. The game stays true to the visual spirit of the original Pong (1972). This project, ft_transcendence, is part of the curriculum at Hive Helsinki (42 School).",
