2. Visit https://localhost:5173 ‚Üí Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"
3. Refresh the application page

### Complete Certificate Reset
If you encounter persistent SSL issues:
```bash
rm -rf backend/certs frontend/certs
./generate-certs.sh
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

### CORS Issues

- ‚úÖ https://localhost:5173
- ‚ùå http://localhost:5173
