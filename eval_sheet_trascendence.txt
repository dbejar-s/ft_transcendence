General instructions

Use of Libraries and Tools
Ensure that the team has not used libraries or tools that provide an immediate complete solution for a global feature or module.
Verify that any direct instruction about the usage (can, must, can't) of a third-party library or tool has been followed.
The use of small libraries or tools that solve a simple and unique task, representing a subcomponent of a global feature or module, is allowed.
The team must justify any usage of library or tool that is not explicitly approved by the subject.
The evaluator must determine if the usage of a specific library or tool is legitimate (and allowed) or almost solving an entire feature or module (and therefore prohibited).
Yes
No

Preliminary tests
Any credentials, API keys, environment variables must be set inside a .env file during the evaluation. In case any credentials, API keys are available in the git repository and outside of the .env file created during the evaluation, the evaluation stop and the mark is 0.
Ensure the needed files to build and launch the container (ex: docker compose file) are at the root of the repository.
Run the command to build and run the container (ex: "docker-compose up --build").
Since the rating of this project is more flexible, do not stop the evaluation process unless you encounter a 500 error, a crash, or anything that actually doesn't work within the project scope.
